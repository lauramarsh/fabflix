Substring Matching for Search
For search queries we chose to use the following pattern : LIKE ‘% query %’, 
so that a user can type in a keyword for a movie, star name, or director and have values return for any entry containing their query.  

Substring Matching for Browse
For browse queries we used the following pattern : LIKE ‘Letter&’, 
so that a user can query the list of movies for movies beginning with a specific letter.
